This repo is dedicated to provide an IRAF-like reduction scheme for long-slit spectra using Python. This is not because IRAF is bad (it is not), but because it is no longer supported so we need to find other solutions that easy to install and easy to introduce, e.g. as part of teaching. For installation, work-flow and code philosphy see here.
